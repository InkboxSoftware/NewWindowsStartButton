The New Windows Start Button is an app to replace your existing Windows Start Button.

Simply open the app and select an image file from your computer, select a background color for the window, and then adjust the size as necessary. Once you click begin the app will no longer appear as a task in the taskbar and the image will overlay the Windows Start Button.

Double click the image to bring the original window back up. Clicking the reset button will reset all settings to default. 

Clicking on The New Windows Start Button window while it is overlaying the start button will not bring up the start menu. Users should instead press the Meta key (Windows Key) on their keyboard to bring it up. 

Clicking on the taskbar may cause The New Windows Start Button window to lose its position as the top TopMost Window, but within a few seconds it should appear again.
